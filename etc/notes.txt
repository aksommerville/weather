Getting a ServiceWorker in local Chrome is no problem but getting it onto the phone will be trouble:
 - ServiceWorker is only allowed to load via HTTPS, or from localhost.
 - Self-signed certificates are not allowed for ServiceWorkers, even if you've already accepted it for the main page load.
I think we'll need to serve the app over AWS to get it on to the phone.

OK it works locally -- load the app, kill the server, refresh, and the service worker takes care of all the static stuff. Awesome!

Pack Javascript and CSS.

The NWS-provided icons are nice, but let's make our own and pack them up in the JS.
What are the possible "shortForecast"?
  - OAS doesn't enumerate them.
  - A quick search doesn't turn up any list either.
  - Just use some common sense.
  Uh now that I think about it, we really don't need these icons.
